/**
 * Extender that will be called during `takeOff` to customize the Airship instance.
 *
 * The `AirshipPluginExtender` interface allows you to customize the initialization of the Airship SDK
 * during the app's startup process. By implementing this interface and registering it in the Android
 * manifest, you can extend Airship's behavior before the `takeOff` method is completed.
 *
 * To register your extender, include the following in your app's `AndroidManifest.xml`:
 *
 * ```xml
 * <application ...>
 *
 *     <meta-data android:name="com.urbanairship.plugin.extender"
 *         android:value="com.example.AirshipExtender" />
 *
 *     <!-- ... -->
 * </application>
 * ```
 *
 * The `AirshipPluginExtender` provides two methods:
 * - `onAirshipReady`: Called when the Airship SDK is initialized and ready to be used. It allows you to
 *   perform custom logic after the SDK is ready.
 * - `extendConfig`: Used to modify the Airship SDK configuration before the SDK takes off.

     * This method is called during the initialization process, before the Airship SDK has fully taken off.
     * It is the ideal place to set extensions or customizations, ensuring they are applied before they are used
     * by the Airship SDK. This includes configuring listeners, overrides, or custom behaviors.
     *
     * **Important:** Avoid long-running or blocking calls in this callback as it will delay Airship from being able
     * to process notifications.
