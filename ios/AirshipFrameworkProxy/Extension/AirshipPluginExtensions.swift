///
/// The `AirshipPluginExtensions` class provides hooks (closures and delegates) that allow hybrid apps or plugin developers
/// to customize or override default behavior in the underlying native SDK. These hooks allow apps built with frameworks
/// like React Native, Cordova, Capacitor, and Flutter to customize certain behaviors without breaking the base plugin.

    /// that the default deep link handling should occur or that the app/plugin wants to perform custom handling.
